# 👋 Hi, I’m DPSHV

I’m a **System Administrator / DevOps Engineer** working with Linux, automation, and cloud environments.  
This GitHub is my place to collect tools, scripts, and documentation that make everyday work faster and more reliable.

## 🛠️ What you’ll find here
- **Bash & Linux scripts** → practical utilities for monitoring, automation, and troubleshooting.  
- **Infrastructure & DevOps configs** → Ansible, Docker, CI/CD, networking.  
- **Cloud & system notes** → concise documentation for AWS, Azure, and on-prem systems.  
- **Knowledge snippets** → notes with best practices and quick references.

## 🎯 Approach
- **Practical focus** → tools that solve real sysadmin and DevOps problems.  
- **Production mindset** → error handling, logging, clean structure.  
- **Clear documentation** → everything should be reusable and easy to follow.
