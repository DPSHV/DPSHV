# 👋 Hi, I’m @DPSHV

DevOps-curious with a keyboard wired straight into the terminal.  
I like figuring out how things work under the hood — and then scripting them until they behave.

---

## 🚧 Currently Building

- A **toolkit of Bash scripts** for real-world sysadmin & DevOps tasks  
  (because writing 100 tiny scripts teaches you more than reading 1 big book)
- Habit: every day, something useful, something working, something I understand

---

## 🧠 What I'm Into

- Linux internals, observability, process control
- Bash scripting that’s safe, readable, and reusable
- Systemd, cron, logging, uptime — the boring stuff that makes everything possible
- Automating the parts that shouldn’t need humans

---

## 🔍 Not Just Learning — Practicing

I’ve touched enough production systems to know that:
- good logs > pretty dashboards
- shell scripts rot unless they’re clean
- flags like `--dry-run` save lives

So now I'm building things the right way. Slowly. Repeatedly.
